# Pandoc template for LSPE/Strip reports

This folder provides a Pandoc template to create beautiful LSPE/Strip
reports from Markdown files.

![](./pandoc_lspe.png)

The following features are currently supported:

- [X] Production of a compliant title page
- [X] Multiple authors
- [X] Support for BibTeX bibliographies
- [X] Change list
- [X] Table of contents
- [X] Abstract
- [X] Support for Unicode characters


## Requisites

You need Pandoc, of course, as well as a number of LaTeX packages. The
template uses LuaLaTeX, in order to properly support Unicode
characters. The document is based on the standard `article` class.


## How to use it

Copy `example.md`, `lspe_template.tex`, and `lspe_logo.pdf` in some
folder, and change `example.md` as you wish. Compile it with the
following options:

    pandoc --template=lspe_template.tex \
        --filter=pandoc-citeproc \
        -f markdown+footnotes+table_captions+tex_math_double_backslash \
        -t latex \
        --pdf-engine=lualatex \
        -o example.pdf example.md
    
Here is an explanation of the flags used:

- `--template=lspe_template.tex`: this is fundamental, as it specifies
  the template to use in the generation of the document.
- `--filter=pandoc-citeproc`: this must be used if you want a
  bibliography (see below) to appear in the document.
- `-f markdown+footnotes+tex_math_double_backslash`: this flag
  specifies the dialect used in the input file. The dialect should
  always begin with `markdown`; other fields specify plugins that
  enable additional features (see the [Pandoc User's
  Guide](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html)). There are no specific
  requirements on the plugins; the provided `Makefile` uses these:
  - `tex_math_double_backslash` enables writing LaTeX equations within
    `\\(` and `\\)`.
- `-t latex`: this is required, as the Pandoc template is written in
  LaTeX;
- `--pdf-engine=lualatex`: you could probably use `xelatex` as well,
  but `lualatex` plays nicely with Unicode characters. (`pdflatex` is
  not supported.)
- `-o example.pdf`: name of the output file. If you pass a name ending
  with `.tex`, the intermediate LaTeX file will be written instead; in
  this case, there is no need to use the `--pdf-engine` flag.


## Document metadata

A number of information used to build the document must be included in
the so-called *header*: a block of text enclosed within three slashes:
`---`. The text should follow the YAML format, and will look more or
less like this (taken from `example.md`):

```yaml

  - "S. Trip"
  - "S. Wipe"
